                            <h1>Lys is a programmer and designer for the web and games. Her main career interest is web design and front-end development.</h1>
                            <p>Lys is currently attending university full-time where she is studying information technology.</p>
                            <p>Some of the technologies she has used in projects are Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, <a href="https://github.com/irisoflys/jobographic" target="_blank" title="Jobographic Web Application">APIs</a>, and Wordpress, although she also loves making graphics and illustrations. Currently she is interested in Wordpress (and maybe Tumblr) theme development and is working on making a <a href="{{ site.url }}/2018-blog" target="_blank" title="blog">blog</a> and maintaining a social media presence.</p>
                            <p>When not coding, she is either watching dramas or anime, writing, or posting her artwork online. As a completionist, she loves checking off every little thing that has to be done. She has a family of parrotlets which she loves dearly, and unsurprisingly considers birds and lizards some of her favorite animals.</p>
